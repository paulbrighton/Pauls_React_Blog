                I’m Paul and I am currently seeking a role hopefully in a creative digital agency as a Front-End Developer. I have worked for Hitachi Capital as a UI Developer and I also did three weeks commercial experience at Shift Commerce working on the Matalan website as part of the ProCoders course I did.
              </p>
              <p>
                I passed a Level 3 RQF course in web design and development and I also completed the first year of the FdA Creative and Digital Industries course at the University Centre at Wakefield College in which I passed with merit.
              </p>
              <p>
                I decided not to do my second year at university due to the lecturer leaving the course and a suitable lecturer not been available for the second year. This led me into looking for other web development courses and I found that the {Pro}Coders course covered the skills I would need to pursue a career as a developer.

                  I’m Paul and I am currently seeking a role hopefully in a creative digital agency as a Front-End Developer. I have worked for Hitachi Capital as a UI Developer and I also did three weeks commercial experience at Shift Commerce working on the Matalan website as part of the ProCoders course I did.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I passed a Level 3 RQF course in web design and development and I also completed the first year of the FdA Creative and Digital Industries course at the University Centre at Wakefield College in which I passed with merit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I decided not to do my second year at university due to the lecturer leaving the course and a suitable lecturer not been available for the second year. This led me into looking for other web development courses and I found that the {Pro}Coders course covered the skills I would need to pursue a career as a developer.

                    I’m Paul and I am currently seeking a role hopefully in a creative digital agency as a Front-End Developer. I have worked for Hitachi Capital as a UI Developer and I also did three weeks commercial experience at Shift Commerce working on the Matalan website as part of the ProCoders course I did.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I passed a Level 3 RQF course in web design and development and I also completed the first year of the FdA Creative and Digital Industries course at the University Centre at Wakefield College in which I passed with merit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I decided not to do my second year at university due to the lecturer leaving the course and a suitable lecturer not been available for the second year. This led me into looking for other web development courses and I found that the {Pro}Coders course covered the skills I would need to pursue a career as a developer.
